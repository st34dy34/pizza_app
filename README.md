## Project Goals
- **Learn MVC Architecture**: 
  - **Model**: Represents data and application logic (Pizza, Topping, Order, Sales, Payment).
  - **View**: Handles the display of the user interface (UI) and processing user inputs.
  - **Controller**: Manages the logic between Model and View.

- **Practice Design Patterns**: 
  - **Factory Pattern**: For creating pizza objects or orders.
  - **Strategy Pattern**: For handling different payment methods.
  - **Singleton Pattern**: For managing sales (Sales).
  - **Decorator Pattern**: For adding toppings to pizzas.
  - **Observer Pattern (optional)**: Notifications on order status changes.
  - **Command Pattern**: For processing user commands in the menu.
